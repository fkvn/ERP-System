1. We can't inject an EntityManager into an EntityListener (through @PersistenceContext). EntityListener is not managed
by any of the containers

2. @PersistenceContext class cannot be static. So we cant attain the instance while class loading.

3. EntityListeners are instantiated by JPA, so Spring does not have an opportunity to inject EntityManager

4. To use EntityManager in EntityListener or other Entities, declare and initialize it with BeanUtil class
